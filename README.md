# How to run the project

2. Get the project. You can either:
  * Clone the repo with git: `git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git`.
  * [Clone with GitHub Desktop](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
  * [Download the latest release](https://github.com/OscarDoc/media-roster/archive/master.zip)
3. Open a command-line window.
