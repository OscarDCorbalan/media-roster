# Check the generated index.html
You can directly open http://oscardcorbalan.github.io/media-roster/.  
You can also do step 2 in 'How to run' and open `index.html` locally.

# How to run the project

To run the project and build index.html again, follow these steps:

1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)  if you don't have it already.
2. Grab a copy of the project. You can either:
  * Clone the repo with git: `git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git`.
  * [Clone with GitHub Desktop](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
  * [Download the latest release](https://github.com/OscarDCorbalan/media-roster/archive/master.zip)
3. Open a command-line window.
4. Direct to the folder of the project.
5. Once in it, run `python build.py`.

The script will build an index.html file and automatically open it in your browser.
