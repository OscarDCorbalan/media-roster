# How to run the project

You can directly open [http://oscardoc.github.io/media-roster/], or just do step 2 and open `index.html` in the project folder to see the pre-constructed page.  
To run the project and build index.html again, follow these steps:

1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)  if you don't have it already.
2. Get the project. You can either:
  * Clone the repo with git: `git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git`.
  * [Clone with GitHub Desktop](github-windows://openRepo/https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
  * [Download the latest release](https://github.com/OscarDoc/media-roster/archive/master.zip)
3. Open a command-line window.
4. Direct to the folder of the project.
5. Once in it, run `python build.py`.

The script will build an index.html file and automatically open it in your browser.
